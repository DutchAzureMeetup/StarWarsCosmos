# Cosmos DB Lab: TIE Fighter Troubles

This repository contains all resources for a Star Wars themed Azure Cosmos DB lab used for Dutch Azure Meetup.
Feel free to use this lab in your own meetups. The provided data sets use a lot of metadata retrieved using [The Star Wars API](https://swapi.co).

Completed mission achievements can be displayed to add a competitive element to the lab.
